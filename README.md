# Password Strength Explanation

The 30 users in users.json are divided into three groups based on their passwords strength: weak, medium, and strong.

1. Weak Passwords (first 10 users)

These are passwords like 123456, password, qwerty, abc123, and 0000.
They’re considered weak because they are very common and easy to guess. 
Most of them use only numbers or very simple words, so an attacker can crack them easily.

2. Medium Passwords (users 11–20)

This group includes passwords such as Sunflower92, BlueSky2024, and TigerCat77.
These are stronger than the first group because they mix letters and numbers and are usually longer. 
However, they still follow a predictable pattern (a word + numbers), so they can still be guessed with smarter attack methods.

3. Strong Passwords (users 21–30)

The last group uses passwords like Gk9!pA42v@L and Mx@91_vT7s*.
These are considered strong because they look random and include upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
They don’t follow a clear pattern, which makes them much harder to crack.
